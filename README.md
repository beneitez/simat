This is a repository containing different scripts to be used with SIMSON, mostly as post-processing visualization tools.

### Present scripts ###

* process_plane.m: reads a plane in xz or xy direction saved by SIMSON, allows several options. Does not require other scripts.
* pread.m: function similar to readdns.m already existing in the repository, however adapted to get the full pressure field. Requires same scripts as readdns.m
* post_proc_amp.m: post processes an amplitude file from SIMSON. This case is specially designed for a turbulent channel flow. Does not require other scripts
